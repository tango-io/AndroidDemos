# DaggerDemo

This it's a simple implementation of [Dagger2](https://github.com/google/dagger), [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit) And [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi) using the [MVVM architecture](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide)

It uses the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/api) to get the list of pokemons and also the information about they

You don't need to do something special before download the project because the PokeAPI it's open
